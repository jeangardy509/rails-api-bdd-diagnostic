## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `bin/rake routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rake test` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.
